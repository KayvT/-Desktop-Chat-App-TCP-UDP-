Reach is a python chat app that was developed with the intent of having a bit of practice with PyQt5, Sockets, and threads/signals. 


How to use it:
 * Make sure you install the requirments first by running:
   `pip install requirments.txt`
   
 * Run the 2 server files; tcpserver, and udpserver
 * Run 2 or however many you like of the ClientWithThreading.py
 * write your name, the ip address you want to connect to, default is local host 127.0.0.1 and the dfeault port is 5000
 * then click connect and voila! Start chatting!
 
 
 **NOTES:** 
 - You can change the default address by editing them in the _server files_ themseleves.
