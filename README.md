A desktop chat app developed with PyQt. 



### How it looks like

- The user interface looks like the following.

- A user can connect to an open server(given the ip address of that server). Also, the user chooses between the two available protocols TCP & UDP.

- When the user connects. They can start chatting, send sound messages, and even transfer files. A file is transfered when a user clicks download. The sender could cancel the uploading before the receiver starts receiving. Also, the lost packets are reported in the terminal, and reordered if it changes order on its way.
